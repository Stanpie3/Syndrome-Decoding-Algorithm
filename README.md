# Syndrome-Decoding-Algorithm
Repository contains a matrix library and the Decoder itself

The Decoder.h (.cpp) class and Matrix.h (.cpp) library are related to the syndrome decoding algorithm (c++). The data.txt file represents an example of format for data to compute. The test.cpp file is responcible for connection between the encoder and decoder.

STS.m file is responsible for displaying messages with usage of finate geometries.

simulate_multiuser.m file is an enviroment which is used to emulate the channel, encode the message and call a decoder function (syndrome decoder).
