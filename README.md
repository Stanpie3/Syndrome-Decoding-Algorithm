# Syndrome-Decoding-Algorithm
Repository contains a matrix library and the Decoder itself

The Decoder.h (.cpp) class and Matrix.h (.cpp) library are related to the syndrome decoding algorithm (c++). The data.txt file represents an example of format for data to compute

STS.m file is responsible for displaying messages with usage of finate geometries.

simulate_multiuser.m file is an enviroment which is used to emulate the channel, encode the message and call a decoder function (syndrome decoder).
